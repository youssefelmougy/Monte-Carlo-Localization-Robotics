# Monte Carlo Localization - Robotics

This project implements a particle filter to use it to improve the execution performance of a simulation robot tracking a path generated by RRT.

The monte_carlo_localization.ipynb notebook should be used on a Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to interactively see the robot movements.

The following is the resulting movement of the robot with improvements using Monte Carlo Localization:
